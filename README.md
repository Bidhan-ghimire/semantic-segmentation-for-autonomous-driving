# Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving

![Teaser figure](assets/teaser.png)

This repository contains semantic segmentation experiments using **DeepLabV3+** (TensorFlow/Keras) with **ResNet18** and **ResNet50** backbones. The notebooks cover training and evaluation on **CamVid** and **Cityscapes**.

This project was completed as a **capstone project** for the course **Introduction to Deep Learning**, taught by **Dr. Stephen Scott** at the **University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL)** in **Spring 2022**.
